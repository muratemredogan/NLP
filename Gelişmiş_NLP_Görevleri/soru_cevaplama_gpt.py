# question = '''What is Machine Learning?'''
# context = ''' Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance 
#                 on a specific task. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or 
#                 decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Machine learning algorithms are used in the applications of email filtering, detection 
#                 of network intruders, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task. Machine learning 
#                 is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, 
#                 theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on exploratory 
#                 data analysis through unsupervised learning.In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics. '''
